# ðŸŽ¬ GSAP Animations Practice by Yukti

Welcome to my GSAP animation practice playground! This repo documents everything I'm learning and experimenting with as I explore the powerful [GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)](https://gsap.com/gsap/).

## ðŸ“Œ What I'm Learning

I'm currently learning how to animate HTML elements using GSAPâ€™s core methods like:

- `gsap.to()` â€“ to animate properties *from current â†’ target state*
- `gsap.from()` â€“ to animate properties *from a starting state â†’ current state*
- Animation properties such as:
  - `x`, `y` â†’ for movement
  - `rotate` â†’ rotation
  - `backgroundColor` â†’ color changes
  - `duration`, `delay` â†’ for timing
  - `repeat`, `yoyo` â†’ to create looping and reversing animations

---

## âœ¨ What Iâ€™ve Built

In this current practice session, I animated four different boxes (`#box`, `#box2`, `#box3`, `#box4`) using combinations of GSAP properties.

### ðŸ”„ Animation Features Explored:
- Infinite looping using `repeat: -1`
- Reversing animations with `yoyo: true`
- Staggered start times using `delay`
- Coordinated movement on the `x` and `y` axes
- Color transitions with `backgroundColor`
- Using both `.to()` and `.from()` methods

## ðŸ’¡ Sample Code Snippet
```js
gsap.to("#box", {
  x: 100,
  duration: 3,
  delay: 1,
  backgroundColor: "red",
  yoyo: true,
  repeat: -1
});
